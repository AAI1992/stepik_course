This repository was created to show homework from "Test Automation with Selenium and Python" courses: https://stepik.org/course/575/syllabus 

Please don't judge me harshly, I just recently started testing and I have little experience, but I have a great desire to develop this skill.

Hope you'll enjoy my code! Good luck)
